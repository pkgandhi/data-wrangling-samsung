### Goal:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts columns containing mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Creates variables called ActivityLabel and ActivityName that label all observations with the corresponding activity labels and names respectively
4. From the data set in step 3, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
